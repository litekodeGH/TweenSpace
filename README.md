# tweenspace

TweenSpace is a Javascript library that tweens object properties producing silky smooth animations. It is an optimized tweening engine written from square one in pure Javascript with no dependencies. Easily handles multiple properties such as hexadecimal, rgb and rgba colors, numeric css properties, 2d/3d transform as well as affecting one or more objects in a single call.  An efficient implementation of data structures features makes this engine able to manipulate tons of simultaneous tweens, preserving high performance and fluid animations. Suited with powerful algorithms capable of managing tweening conflicts, redundant properties and complex animations among other features.

TweenSpace encapsulates two core classes, Clip and Sequence. Both responsible of the tween creation, management and sequencing. Tweenspace is an static 'class' that controls global playback, provides methods to create Clips and Sequences, numerous easing functions and contains the engine loop which handles iterations over Clip and Sequence instances.
